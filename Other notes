- An R ‘list’ is an object
 consisting of an ordered collection of objects
 known as its components.- Components can be numbers, vectors, matrices, characters etc. No specific type. 
Lst = list(name="Fred", wife="Mary", no.children=3, child.ages=c(4,7,9))
 Lst
 Lst[[1]]
 Lst[[4]][1]
 # To print a component in a ‘list’, we use double box bracket [[ ]].
 # If that component is a vector and we want extract one specific value from that vector, we 
use [ ] after the [[ ]].

 length(Lst) gives the number of (top level) components the list has.
 The component may be referred to by giving the component name:
 Lst$name
 Lst$wife

A data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure.
 Vector structures appearing as variables of the data frame must all have the same 
length. 
Matrix structures must all have the same row size.
 # Create the data frame.
 emp.data = data.frame(
 emp_id = c (1:5), 
emp_name = c("Rick","Dan","Michelle","Ryan","Gary"),
 salary = c(623.3,515.2,611.0,729.0,843.25),   
start_date = as.Date(c("2012-01-01", "2013-09-23", "2014-11-15", "2014-05-11",
 "2015-03-27")),
 stringsAsFactors = FALSE
 )
 # Print the data frame.   
emp.data
