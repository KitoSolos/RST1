	data <- read.csv("C:/Users/Kito/OneDrive/Desktop/Uni books/SY/2022_Japan_CPI_GoodsAndServiceClassificationIndex.csv")
	All_items <- data$All.items
	max(All_items, na.rm = TRUE)

In the first line of code, I imported a .csv data file. 
This is a dataset of all the consumer price indices In Japan from 1970 to 2022. 
In the second line of code, I assigned a subset of the data under the column in the table “All items” to the name “ALL_items.” 
From the third line of code and onwards I used ‘R’ functions to calculate the maximum value, minimum value, median, mean, variance, the 25th percentile, 
the 75th percentile and the Interquartile range of all the values under the “All items” column in the table.
I used the argument “na.rm = TRUE” to remove or to not consider any null values in the table.


	A = as.matrix(data[2:5, 2:5])
	A
	B = as.matrix(data[2:5,48:51])
	B
	C = A%*%B
	C
 	C[3,4]
In line 3 I used the ‘as.matrix’ function to create a matrix of the values in the .csv file from comprised of all the values from row 2 to 5 and column 2 to 5 and assigned it to the matrix name ‘A’. 
In the next line I printed the matrix ‘A.’ I did the same with matrix B in the next line, creating a matrix from value in row 2 to 5 and columns 48 to 51. 
In the following line I printed matrix ‘B.’ I then used the ‘%*%’ operation to multiply matrices ‘A’ and ‘B’ and then assigned the resultant matrix to the matrix name ‘C.’ 
I then printed the matrix ‘C’ in the next line. I then a function that returns the value of the element in row 3 column 4 of matrix ‘C.’
